# About CS 135

This course is an introduction to modern problem solving and programming methods. Emphasis is placed on algorithm development. A special focus will be on procedural and data abstraction, emphasizing design, testing, and documentation.

The primary objective of this course is to provide students with the skills necessary for programming and problem solving using a computer. **The principal programming language utilized in this course is C++**. Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

* Analyze and explain the behavior of programs involving fundamental program constructs
* Write programs that use those fundamental program constructs
* Organize, design, and document programs
* Design algorithms that solve a stated problem
* Describe basic data structures
* Utilize the Visual Studio Code editor to write programs
* Apply the fundamentals of object-oriented programming
