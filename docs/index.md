## Welcome to CS 135!

I'm thrilled to be teaching this course! For many of you, this will be your first dive into the vast and growing world of computer science. I'm honored and grateful that you have chosen me to be your instructor. I've been teaching computer science at TMCC since the Fall of 2022. Over the past several semesters, I've been continually impressed by the passion and curiosity that so many students bring into this course. 

Computers are indeed deeply integrated into nearly every part of our daily lives, and continually find applications in new areas every day. The goal of this course is to give you the skills to give computers instructions on how to solve problems.
